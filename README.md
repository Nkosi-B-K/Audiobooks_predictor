# Audiobooks_predictor
Predicting the likelihood of customers returning to make purchases on an Audiobook site. 
The objectice here was to predict if a customer would buy again from the AudioBook company based on the data provided.
The company is looking to improve sales and profitability figures on repeat buyers and is looking for important metrics for covnersion.
We were looking for only two classes: "Customers who will buy" and "Customers who won't buy".
The process followed was preprocessing of the data in balancing the data, dividing the data into 3 parts (training, validation and test sets)
This was followed by saving the data into a TensorFlow friendly format.
Following this the Machine Learning algorithm was created.
